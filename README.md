Hi, I am @ClmtMlt or Cl√©ment MOLLET,
I am 27 years old and I live in Bordeaux since 6 years.

Currently, I am looking for coding experiences around FullStacks missions to enhance my skills.
I did an intensive full-time bootcamp of 9 weeks in Le Wagon Bordeaux to develop my softskills and hardskills around coding.

I am now a full-time Developer working on a lot of projects to build my own portfolio and try to find the perfect Job or missions to keep progressing!
I have learned Ruby, HTML, CSS, JS, React, Vue, Ruby on Rails, Stimulus, Bootstrap and I will soon start more, I need to fix all of these before starting something new.
I used to work on MacBook and Windows, it doesn't matter, I have both at home.


At this time, I am working on different projects:

-My WebCV, an Web App to show my skill to perform an unique CV

-GuideBySo, a french "influenceur" asked me to build her a fully functionnal website asap from scratch

If you want to learn a bit more about me,

I am in love with plants, I used to propagate some rare plants at my home, I trade some good advices to my friend and I am my friend's plants doctor... Can I call myself Dr Mollet ? 

I love astronomy, art, treking, coding, fishing, architecture, judo and specially music! I can't do anything without music, my personnal sourcec of inspiration in term of music is Hans Zimmer.

I studied scciences for 2 years and architecture for 3 years, I am enjoying Maths, Physics and Chemistry a lot, solving problems is cool.
